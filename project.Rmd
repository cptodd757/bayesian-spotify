## Analysis

```{r}
data <- read_csv("data/Travis Scott_Drake_DaBaby_Ed Sheeran_Ariana Grande_Billie Eilish_ILLENIUM_Diplo_Tiësto_2019.csv")
```

```{r}
data %>% select("artist") %>% unique()
```

Merge specific genres that we intend to use into a more broad genre category.
```{r}

data <- data %>% mutate(
  genre = case_when(
    artist == "Travis Scott" | artist == "Drake" | artist == "DaBaby" ~ "rap", 
    artist == "Ed Sheeran" | artist == "Ariana Grande" | artist == "Billie Eilish" ~ "pop", 
    artist == "ILLENIUM" | artist == "Diplo" | artist == "Tiësto" ~ "edm"
  )
)

```
